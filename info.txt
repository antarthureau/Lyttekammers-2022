MACHINE-SETUP
RPi 2B+ or 3B+ with Raspbian 32bits running;
User is mike, password is standard linux;
A USB flashdrive is connected and contains media files;
A Beetle (Arduino Leonardo) is used to get serial data from a buton;

PUREDATA
Path/directory: /home/mike/Desktop/LTKM.pd
Puredata vanilla + GUI should be installed;
Comport and Pduino external libraries should be installed with Deken in
/home/mike/Documents/Pd/externals", then declared in the patch.

BEETLE-ARDUINO
The beetle is a small form-factor Arduino Leonardo microcontroller;
It is programmed to generate a toggle (toggle 0 or 1) via serial to Pd;
Connected to the beetle digital pin 9 is a push-button, wired to
ground with a 10K resistor (pull-down);

MEDIA
LTKM-MEDIA directory/path: /media/mike/LTKM-MEDIA;
The media files are located on a flashdrive (LTKM-MEDIA)
To update the files, simply put/replace .WAV files  on the drives;
Files should be named "mediaX.wav" (replace x by integer);

AUTOSTART
Autostart directory/path: /home/mike/.config/autostart/LTKM.desktop
The autostart .desktop file, starts a bash script deleting empty /media/mike locations;
and launches the patch.
---------------
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=LTKM
Exec=bash /home/mike/Desktop/autostartLTKM.sh
---------------

The bash script takes care of removing any corrupted, empty directories in /media/mike/;
then launches the app
---------------
#!/bin/bash
cd /media/mike
sudo find . -type d -empty -print -delete
sleep 2
pd /home/mike/Desktop/lyttekammers.pd
---------------

If the name of the patch is changed during an update,
it must be changed in the bash script as well. Example:
pd /home/mike/Desktop/newPatch.pd

The bash script is located on the desktop.
