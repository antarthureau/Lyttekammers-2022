MACHINE-SETUP
RPi 2B+ or 3B+ with Raspbian 32bits running;
User is mike, password is standard linux;
A USB flashdrive is connected and contains media files;
A Beetle (Arduino Leonardo) is used to get serial data from a buton;

PUREDATA
Path/directory: /home/mike/Desktop/lyttekammers-pd-patch.pd
Puredata vanilla + GUI should be installed;
Comport external library should be installed with Deken in
/home/mike/Documents/Pd/externals";
"github.com/alexdrymonitis/Arduino_Pd" should be placed in
/home/mike/Documents/Pd/externals", then declared in the patch.

BEETLE-ARDUINO
The beetle is a small form-factor Arduino Leonardo microcontroller;
It is programmed to generate a toggle (toggle 0 or 1) via serial to Pd;
Connected to the beetle digital pin 9 is a push-button, wired to
ground with a 10K resistor (pull-down);

MEDIA
LTKM-MEDIA directory/path: /media/mike/LTKM-MEDIA;
The media files are located on a flashdrive (LTKM-MEDIA)
To update the files, simply put/replace .WAV files  on the drives;
Files should be named "mediaX.wav" (replace x by integer);

AUTOSTART
Autostart directory/path:
/home/mike/.config/autostart/lyttekammers.pd-patch.desktop
The autostart is a .desktop file;
